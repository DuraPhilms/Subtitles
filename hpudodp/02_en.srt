167
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,802
Ron's Dad: And you have the
audacity to still come down here!?

168
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,642
Ron's Mum: You still remember me?
I'm Ron's Mum.

Ehm, hi!

171
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,637
Hütler: Okay mein friends. I would say:
that's enough hugging!

172
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:01,503
Harry: You're just jealous.

173
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,401

what is going on here?

178
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:18,665
Hütler: Well ja, the Order of the TODO,
is one of the greatest Anti-Terror Special-Forces
on the world.

180
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:22,552
Hütler: Ja of course!

181
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,928
Harry: A meeting?

182
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:28,047
Samuel L. Jackson: That's exactly the point, where I
pull out my gun, put it to someone's head ...

183
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:29,912
Samuel L. Jackson: ... and
politely ask him to do what I want.

TV-Show will help with that.

189
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:50,580
Harry: I hope you're not referring to your
spiritual welfare? That was the worst I've ever seen.

190
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:53,078
Hütler: Nein, it's not about the Seelsorge.
Even though you certainly didn't help...

191
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:57,162
Hütler: ...with with it's scheiß quotes.
Don't come me again trying...

192
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:01,900
Hütler: ... to discriminate. Always dies people
with their Xenophobia und prejudice.

193
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,749
Hütler: That's horrible!
Heil never do that!

194
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:08,673

a schmall little TV ad, ...

by Dumbledore because of his crimes.

206
00:09:55,094 --> 00:10:00,099
Penner: If we were to had him in, we would
get paid a high bounty by Dumbledore.

207
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,603
Penner: As well as that, we would also
secure our next contract.

we came to a resolution.

through what you are saying. Does that me---
